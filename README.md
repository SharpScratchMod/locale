## Joke Languages
Currently, we only plan to add two joke languages based on Scratch's Meow and Edible Scratch

If you do have a good idea for one please create an issue **IN THE MAIN SHARP REPO**

We do not want many joke languages as they will fill the language drop down with too many useless languages
